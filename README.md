# Predicting-the-Performance-of-Solar-Cooker-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict the thermal performance of solar cookers – Regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest,or Gradient Boosting are trained to estimate the cooker’s performance (e.g., temperature rise, cooking time, efficiency)
